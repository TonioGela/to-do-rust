//* p1.distance(&p2);
//* (&p1).distance(&p2);
//* The first one looks much cleaner. This automatic referencing behavior works
//* because methods have a clear receiverâ€”the type of self. Given the receiver and
//* name of a method, Rust can figure out definitively whether the method is
//* reading (&self), mutating (&mut self), or consuming (self). The fact that
//* Rust makes borrowing implicit for method receivers is a big part of making
//* ownership ergonomic in practice.
